PRELIMINARY SUBMISSIONS:\nThe petitioner most respectfully submits that the blanket imposition of Section 144 CrPC across the entire Islamabad Capital Territory, without any temporal limitation, constitutes an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 16 and 19 of the Constitution.\n\n2. CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK:\nArticle 16 provides: \"Every citizen shall have the right to assemble peacefully and without arms, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of public order.\" The word 'reasonable' imposes a constitutional obligation on the State to demonstrate proportionality between the restriction and the objective sought to be achieved.\n\n3. RELIANCE ON PRECEDENTS:\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Benazir Bhutto v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1988 SC 416) held that the right to peaceful assembly is a fundamental right which cannot be curtailed except through reasonable restrictions narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest."

It is well-settled law that the Legislature has plenary power in the matter of taxation and the quantum and incidence of tax are matters of legislative policy which cannot be questioned on the ground of reasonableness (Commissioner of Income Tax v. Messrs Eli Lilly Pakistan, PLD 2009 SC 1).\n\n3. The retrospective operation of the tax statute is not per se unconstitutional.

The Commission has a statutory mandate to protect the interests of investors and promote the development of a fair, efficient and transparent securities market.

Amina Khatoon d/o Abdul Ghaffar... RESPONDENT\n\n1. The appellant is aggrieved by the decree dated 30.01.2024 passed by the learned Judge Family Court, Karachi South, whereby custody of the two minor children was awarded to the respondent mother along with maintenance of Rs. 80,000/- per month.\n\n2. The appellant submits that the male child Muhammad Hassan has attained the age of 7 years and under the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, the hizanat (right of custody) of the mother ceases when the boy reaches the age of discretion (seven years).\n\n3. The quantum of maintenance fixed at Rs. 80,000/- is disproportionate to the appellant's income and the standard of living of the parties."

PETITIONER\nVERSUS\nOil and Gas Regulatory Authority... RESPONDENT\n\n1. The petitioner is a public listed company engaged in fertilizer manufacturing, petrochemicals, and energy sectors with a significant stake in natural gas exploration and production.\n\n2. OGRA, through its determination dated 15.02.2024, revised the prescribed price of natural gas for the petitioner's wellhead from Rs. 680/MMBTU to Rs. 450/MMBTU, representing a reduction of 34% without following the consultative process mandated by Section 8(2) of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002.\n\n3. The impugned determination is arbitrary and without lawful authority as OGRA failed to: (a) hold public hearings as required under Rule 4 of the Natural Gas Tariff Rules, 2002; (b) consider the petitioner's submissions on cost of production; and (c) provide reasoned order as mandated by law."

The Authority submits that the impugned price determination was made in exercise of the statutory power conferred under Section 8(2) of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002 read with the Natural Gas Tariff Rules, 2002.\n\n2. The determination was based on a comprehensive review of the cost structure, international gas price benchmarks, and the policy directive issued by the Federal Government under Section 21 of the OGRA Ordinance directing the Authority to ensure affordable gas supply to the fertilizer sector in the national interest.\n\n3. The petitioner's contention that the consultative process was not followed is factually incorrect. The Authority issued notices under Rule 4 and held public hearings on 01.02.2024 and 08.02.2024 at which the petitioner's representatives were present and made submissions."

RESPONDENT\n\n1. The appellant was tried and convicted under Section 302(b) PPC by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gujranwala and sentenced to imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs. 200,000/-.\n\n2. The prosecution case was based on the testimony of two alleged eyewitnesses, PW-3 and PW-5, and recovery of a blood-stained knife from the appellant's possession.\n\n3. The appellant submits that both eyewitnesses are interested witnesses being close relatives of the deceased, their statements contain irreconcilable contradictions regarding the weapon used and the number of injuries, and the medical evidence does not support the ocular account."

The appeal is ALLOWED and the appellant is ACQUITTED of the charge. He shall be released forthwith if not required in any other case."
